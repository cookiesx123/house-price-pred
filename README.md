# About
This project was conducted to analyze the housing market in and build a predictive model for housing prices. The goal was to better understand the key factors influencing house prices and provide insights into the current state of the real estate market in the city. The project followed a structured approach involving data analysis and model building (linear regression). First I prepared the data, checked if any cleaning was necessary and proceded to vizualize the data. I divided the dataset into a training sample and a test sample. Then, using Linear Regression I checked how the model performs with the data using RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error. To make sure there was no overfitting I used k- fold cross-validation and then made conclussions regarding the whole analysis.
