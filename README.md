It contains 8 variables with 1000 observations.
# About
This project was conducted to analyze the housing market in and build a predictive model for housing prices. The goal was to better understand the key factors influencing house prices and provide insights into the current state of the real estate market. First, the data was cleaned and prepared to ensure its quality for analysis. I then proceeded with exploratory data analysis to visualize trends and relationships between variables. The dataset was split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance. A Linear Regression model was implemented to predict housing prices, and its performance was assessed using RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. To ensure the model was not overfitting, k-fold cross-validation was applied and lastly I made conclussions regarding the whole analysis.
